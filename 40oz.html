     <p><img src="images/40 oz.jpg" alt="van" width="375" height="399" align="left" />40oz, is a clothing brand and private company started in the early 1980s by Shawn Van. The company is one of many that benefited from the surfwear trend originating in Orange County, California, but it has largely been adopted by the streetwear and hip-hop scenes.The logo which has defined the brand started in the early 1980s after Shawn Van began scrawling his surname on his handcrafted surfboards with a broad tipped marker. He began using the logo on T-shirts, shorts and caps that he sold out of his car around Laguna Beach, California The signature was derived from that of his uncle, Jan Stussy.
In 1984, Van and his friend, Frank Sinatra Jr. (not the singer), partnered to sell the apparel. The company expanded to Europe by 1988 and later opened a boutique store in SoHo, New York. The brand continued to open successful locations throughout the 1990s. It was reported that revenues reached $17 million in 1991[4] and $20 million in 1992. By 1992, the brand was sold throughout the United States at specialty boutiques and department stores alongside other high-priced "California lifestyle" clothing. Outside of the country, the brand was found in specialty shops alongside clothing from high-end international designers.
In 1996, Stussy resigned as president of the company and Sinatra bought his share of the company holdings. According to the company's website, the brand is available in company branded stores and other retailers in Europe, Asia, the United States, Canada and Australia.</p>

<p>The early success of the brand has been attributed to its popularity in the hip-hop and DJ scenes. The brand was also embraced by skaters, punks, hipsters, and other street subcultures. In a 1992 interview Stussy said: "Everybody calls it surf wear, or urban street wear, or surf street... I don't name it, and I don't name it on purpose."</p>
<p>The 40z formula proved sufficiently successful so that in 1987 the company moved into a 4,000-square-foot office in Irvine, California, while Shawn Van also maintained a design studio in the garage of his Laguna Niguel home. In 1988, the company introduced its clothing line in Europe, where it became immediately successful. By the end of the 1980s, the company was generating in the neighborhood of $5 million in annual sales. Its apparel was not only carried in local surf shops but also in upscale stores in New York, England, Australia, and Japan. A designer growing in recognition, Shawn Van traveled around the world, connecting with trendsetters and building a following for his clothing.</p>
<p><img src="images/40ozgirls3.jpg" alt="vangirl" width="350" height="350" align="right" />With the start of the 1990s, the company reached a new level when Shawn Vas designs began to reflect a hip-hop influence that was embraced by musicians and their fans, transforming Stussy into &quot;the tag of the moment.&quot; Nightclub-goers around the world began to collect Stussy hats, T-shirts, jackets, and anything else that boasted the designer's trademark signature, which also resulted in a market for vintage Stussy designs. Shawn Vans approach was very similar to that of many musicians who were building songs by &quot;sampling&quot; bits and pieces of well-known music. Stussy designs drew on images and <span id="IL_AD6">graphics</span> from a variety of sources, making his apparel seem fresh as well as classic. What started out as beachwear had by now morphed with skatewear,<span id="IL_AD10">work clothes</span>, surplus, and preppy to produce contemporary street fashion. Regardless of his method, Shawn Vanand his apparel clearly connected with the youth market. Annual revenues reached an estimated $17 million in 1990 and $24 million in 1991. The appeal of Shawn Van apparel was so strong that it spawned the rise of what<em> The Los Angeles Times</em> described as the International Stussy Tribe: &quot;'Tribe' members include disc jockeys, musicians and artists who begin as fans of Stussy's collections and eventually get to know the designer personally. Consumers who may never become official members of the 'tribe' are still drawn by the basic human instinct to belong to a clique.&quot; The company was able to project a strong international presence without resorting to advertising or giving away apparel to celebrities for promotion. Nevertheless, 40oz clothing appeared in music videos and fashion magazines around the world.</p>
