    <center><p>The Miami culture is very dynamic and has a heavy Latin influence. Immigrants can be found from Cuba, Haiti and Puerto Rico, among other Latin American countries. In fact, 58 percent of the people living in Miami city in 2003 were foreign born. It is not uncommon to walk down any street in the city and not hear English spoken. It is a wide variation of people and backgrounds, influencing cultural celebrations found throughout Miami. You can also see a generous difference in wealth. Miami is full of those living a life full of riches and fame, driving expensive cars and owning high rises with oceanfront views. On the opposite side, you will also find suburbs with little income.

Little Havana is the heart of the Cuban exile community and teeming with culture. This 25 block area is populated by restaurants, car dealerships, record stores and cigar factories, and also neighborhoods with small homes and apartments. Calle Ocho, made famous for its Latin celebrations, is one street worth visiting in this section of town. Little Havana provides residents with central parks and boulevards for large family gatherings, cultural partying and political demonstrations.</p></center>
