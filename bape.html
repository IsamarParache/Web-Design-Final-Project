The company specializes in men's, women's and kids' lifestyle and street wear, running 19 stores in Japan, including Bape Stores, Bape Pirate Stores, Bape Kids Stores, Bapexclusive Aoyama, and Bapexclusive Kyoto. The Kyoto store also includes Bape Gallery, a space used for various events and art shows sponsored by Bape. There are also stores located in Hong Kong, London, New York, Taipei, Paris, Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul and Singapore. The company previously operated Bape Cuts hair salon, Bape Café, and Foot Soldier. Nigo also founded the women's clothing lines &quot;APEE&quot; (currently defunct), and &quot;BAPY&quot; (resurrected in 2010), the female &quot;couture&quot; clothing line.</p>
   <p>Nigo, founder and owner, cites his mother and father, who were a nurse and a billboard maker respectively, as major influences in the development of his character. Though because they both worked, he spent a lot of time alone with toys.He also credits DJ/fashion guru Hiroshi Fujiwara as his business model. His nickname means &quot;number two&quot; in Japanese; the MD of Astoarobot, the fashion store, coined the moniker when he noted the physical resemblance to Fujiwara.Nigo cites his early influences as Elvis, The Beatles and hip-hop acts such as Beastie Boys and Run DMC.<br /></p>
     <p>After studying fashion editing at college, he worked as an editor and a stylist for Popeye magazine. After borrowing four million yen from an acquaintance, who also let him use his shop, he opened; Nowhere, his first store, on April 1, 1993 in Harajuku, Tokyo. Deciding to start his own brand, he named it after the 1968 film Planet of the Apes. According to Nigo, the name BAPE; is a reference to A Bathing Ape In Lukewarm Water. Japanese people typically have daily baths in water at temperatures above 40 degrees celsius (104°F). As such, bathing in luke warm water is to complacently over indulge. This is, ironically, a reference to the lazy opulence of the younger generation of Japanese, the brand's own customers. To expose the brand he gave T-shirts to Cornelius who wore them when performing. For two years he produced 30 to 50 shirts a week, selling half and giving half to friends. In 1997, Nigo released his debut album 'Ape Sounds' under Mo'Wax, with DJ/Producer James Lavelle of UNKLE.  Nigo is also co-owner and head designer of Pharrell Williams' clothes brands Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream.<br /></p>
